# CatTheory4All
A project to create open source, re-usable latex for category theory definitions.

Conversations with Brendan:
1. lenses via Dialectica (why I do not think profunctors are the way to think about lenses)
why they think they are  https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07488

Profunctor optics, a categorical update

2. How to do CHI for classical logic? 
the logic:   An ecumenical notion of entailment. Synthese, 01 February 2019. For Carolina. http://vcvpaiva.github.io/pubs.html

many categorical models, any one is better? polycategories would be my bet, but the SOTA is not there yet?  
“Categorical Proof Theory of Classical Propositional Calculus”, by Bellin, Hyland, Robinson and Urban, 2006 (pdf), 
which is based around *-polycategories, but as far as I understand there’s still plenty of room for debate.

3. Clinical terms my summary is at https://github.com/vcvpaiva/clinical readme. 
ACT angle?  need to read knowledge representation using CT. Evan's paper

4. Encyclopedia of Proof Systems (as above) want to do a version tying in with eBourbaki, 
a dictionary/glossary of mathematical concepts and their latex representations. 
Would be good to connect with the algebraic structures of Peter Jipsen
